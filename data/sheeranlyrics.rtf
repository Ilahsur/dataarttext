\
Come on now\
Dry your eyes\
I'm sick of all your lies\
I've grown to despise you\
\
Already sick of what you're saying\
Hoping now I'm only praying\
My baby's gone away\
And I've already packed my bags\
\
You didn't know me\
(I've run away)\
You couldn't show me\
(What you have to say)\
My one and only\
Has gone away\
\
Far away\
\
You'll never leave me alone\
Now I'm off on my own\
I'll never ring your phone again\
\
And still you keep on crying\
If I said I loved you\
I'd be lying\
You need to dry your eyes\
And I've still gone to pack my bags\
\
You didn't know me\
(I've run away)\
You couldn't show me\
(What you have to say)\
My one and only\
Has gone away\
\
You didn't know me\

Well, I've walked this street\
Well, I've walked this street before\
And everyone's locked up their door\
'Cos they heard me coming\
And I've been running\
From what\
I don't know if she's there\
Or if she's cares\
It's taken you a long time to see\
You've got a goldfish memory\
This song's for you, not for me\
In misery\
You said we went too fast\
And you said we wouldn't last\
Now I've put the past behind me\
And I'm running\

Everybody thinks I must be crazy\

Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze\
Everything's blurry\

"I Love You"\
\
I'm standing on a mountain\
Waiting for you to come\
You were sitting counting\
The days that I had gone\
The note I wrote\
I wrapped up in a cigarette\
Burned away the memories\
I tried to forget\
But not yet\
Wishing my life away\
But these three words\
I have to say to you\
My baby blue\
You know it's true\
I love you\
I love you\
How can I tell you?\
I don't know what to say\
This chance that I won't miss\
But I miss you anyway\
I feel your pain\
It's turning me insane\
Thrown away\
I had to take the last train home\
\
But then you came\
Wishing my life away\
But these three words\
I have to say to you\
My baby blue\
You know it's true\
I love you\
Wishing my life away\
These three words\
I have to say to you\
My baby blue\
You know it's true\
You know it's true\
I love you\
I love you\
I love you\

"Addicted"\
\
I think I took too much\
I'm addicted to your touch\
But I'm crying\
In shame again\
And now I'm high as a kite\
And I know I might be gone\
When you get home\
Oh well, we've come this far\
You're my Venus\
And I'm your Mars\
And we've passed the moon\
and stars\
And I'm gone\
But now I'm high as a kite\
And I know I'm might be gone\
When you get home\
I'm high as a kite\
And I know I'm almost gone\
When you get home\
So please come home\

"Open Your Ears"\

Can\'92t get you off my mind\
Look at me and you will find\
Time after time it seems\

In your world we were the same\
In mine now you\'92re the one to blame\
You can\'92t remember my name\
We\'92re lost, it\'92s such a shame\
\
Listen to me\
Stop making me see\
What I\'92ve been waiting for\
Listen to me\
Stop making me see\

I\'92m strong yet proud\
I\'92m quiet yet loud\
And I\'92m everything\
You want in me\
I\'92m small yet tall\
I have it all\
And I\'92m everything\
You want me to be\

Listen to me\
Stop making me see\

Stop making me see\

I need you still\
And I still feel like\

"Beyond The Pale"\
\
Just lay it all down on me\
It\'92s getting harder for me to breathe\
Just want to know if it will be\
Just want to know if it is me\
\
And you know I\'92ve learned from my mistakes\
And how much have I got to lose?\
You find my heart is hard to break\
Can\'92t keep playing the fool\
\
Breathe in, exhale\
To turn to move beyond the pale\
Flag up, set sail\
To find what\'92s there beyond the pale\
\
I feel like I\'92ve gone to the end of the world\
What do I have to do?\
\
You know I\'92ve learned from my mistakes\
How much have I got to lose?\
You find my heart hard to break\
Can\'92t keep playing the fool\

Breathe in, exhale\

Flag up, set sail\

Just to let you know\
That you\'92re in my mind?\
To try and justify\
The way you liberate me\
Every time\
\
"In Memory"\
\
I write this song in memory of\
The wayward smile\
The boy we won\'92t forget\
The soul you took away from us\
The river flows\
The tears that we wept\
\
Missing you\
Is all that needs to be said\
More than blue\
The words inside my head\
\
And I know that you\'92re gone\
\
The cheeky smile\
Of jokes and laughs\
The memories of times\
We crossed the line\
The stepping stones\
Across my mind\
Washed away\
We all now feel so blind\
\
Missing you\
Is all that needs to be said\
More than blue\
The words inside my head\
\
And I know that you\'92re gone\
\
Goodbye\

"Insomniac's Lullaby"\
\
I\'92m getting very edgy\
Cos you\'92re trying to take this from me\
And it\'92s something that I wanted so bad\
Cos you\'92re the definition\
Of someone who has to ruin\
The best thing that I ever had\
Cos you\'92re a jealous girl\
And all I can say is\
It\'92s your fault but partially mine\
For losing hope\
For not treating you right\
But that will disappear in time\
\
All I gotta do is pass you by\
Never say what\'92s wrong\
Whenever I say why?\
\
Standing in the corner\
Shadowed by the light\
To you I seem much smaller\
But I know it might be you\
How much better could I do\
To be myself, not someone else?\
I\'92m losing sleep\
I live only for the week\
\
I\'92ve grown to ignore you\
Cos when I seem to bore you\
You pretend that you\'92re not interested\
Your eyes start to twinkle\
Your smile starts to widen\
And I just seem to try and forget\
But you pay me no attention\
Even though I do\
But I don\'92t care as long as you\'92re mine\
It\'92s happening every time\
\
All I gotta do is pass you by\
Never say what\'92s wrong\
Whenever I say why?\
\
Standing in the corner\
Shadowed by the light\
To you I seem much smaller\
But I know it might be you\
How much better could I do\

I\'92m losing sleep\
I live only for the week\
\
And I\'92m falling harder now it seems\
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams\
And I can\'92t sleep although I think I can\
It\'92s insomnia I think I have\
But who cares when I\'92m not your man?\
\
Standing in the corner\
Shadowed by the light\
To you I seem much smaller\
But I know it might be you\

Followed footsteps catch my pace\
Broken windows fall in place\
Now shattered lovers find their place\

All the pain and the hurt\
Just to make matters worse\

What can I do to be making you see?\
To come out clean?\
You\'92re better off with me\

We\'92re stuck\
Taking time and wasting mine\
No luck\
Running around and crashing down\
In you I trust nevermore\
Leaving you in sand and glass\

Went up in a cloud of smoke\
How I could I be such a fool\
To ever think that we were close?\

"Way Home"\
\
Well I once heard a story about a run-down home\
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone\
He tried to live, no effort was shown\
He\'92s slowly finding a way back home\
\
He had a family with smiles and frowns\
They never could solve his way to be down\
Cos he\'92s one dog who don\'92t want a bone\
He\'92s slowly finding a way back home\
\
He had a nice house with windows and doors\
He said to his wife what\'92s mine is yours\
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown\
He\'92s slowly finding a way back home\
\
His children have left but the rooms are still there\
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair\
But far from the nest the babies have flown\
He\'92s slowly finding a way back home\
\
His wife was an angel sent from above\
He never returned her kisses or love\
But soon he\'92d found that she\'92d overgrown\
This man who\'92s finding a way back home\
\
So the leaves are all dead in this broken man\'92s June\
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon\
He stares at the floor, no more to roam\
He\'92s slowly finding a way back home\
\
Well I once heard a story about a run-down home\
Where a man with regrets lived all alone\
He tried to live, no effort was shown\
He\'92ll never find a way back home\

I don't want to bruise your ears\
Or hurt you again\
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab\
When I needed a friend\
\
But now I\'92m in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound\
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd\
That\'92s you now, hello, ciao, seems that life is great now\
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud\
And I can\'92t, no, I won\'92t hush\
I\'92ll say the words that make you blush\
I\'92m gonna sing this now\
\
See, I\'92m true, my songs are where my heart is\
I\'92m like glue, I stick to other artists\
I\'92m not you, now that would be disastrous\
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures\
See, I\'92m real, I do it all, it\'92s all me\
I\'92m not fake, don\'92t ever call me lazy\

It'll show me your shadow\
I'm in my place\
Hope you remember\
When summer's gone\
I'll still sing a song\

[Acoustic version:] 'Cause when I'm missing you\
\
I'll stop eating food\
And I'll squeeze into your dress\
So I can feel like you\
But then I saw your bitterness\
[Acoustic version:] And then I'll see your bitterness\
And why you left me too\
I thought I'd put you to a test\
And say that I love you\
I think that I love you\
\
And I'll stop eating food\
And I'll squeeze into your dress\
So I can feel like you\
But then I saw your bitterness\
[Acoustic version:] And then I'll see your bitterness\
And why you left me too\
I thought I put you to a test\
And say that I love you\
Now it seems you loved me too\

\cf2 "The City"\
\
This city never sleeps\
I hear the people walk by when it's late\
Sirens bleed through my windowsill\
I can't close my eyes\
Don't control what I'm into\
This tower is alive\
The lights that blind keep me awake\
With my hood up and lace untied\
Sleep fills my mind\
Don't control what I'm into\
\
London calls me a stranger\
A traveller\
This is now my home, my home\
I'm burning on the back street\
Stuck here sitting in the backseat\
I'm blazing on the street\
What I do isn't up to you\
And if the city never sleeps\
Then that makes two\
\
The pavement is my friend\
Hey, and it will take me where I need to go\
I find it trips me up\
And puts me down\
This is not what I'm used to\
The shop across the road\
Fulfills my needs and gives me company\
When I need it\
Voices speak through my walls\
I don't think I'm gonna make it\
Past tomorrow\
\
London calls me a stranger\
A traveller\
This is now my home, my home\
I'm burning on the back street\
Stuck here sitting in the backseat\
I'm blazing on the street\
What I do isn't up to you\
And if the city never sleeps\
Then that makes two\
\
And my lungs hurt\
And my ears bled\
With the sound of the city life\
Echoed in my head\
Do I need this to keep me alive?\
The traffic stops and starts\
But I need to move along\
\
I'm from a city where the rain won't sleep\
Pollution in the air matches that on the street\
The black smoke\
Gets your head into a muddle like\
Walking into elephants\
Syringes in a puddle like\
I was a country boy when I moved out\
Grew up to fast for my family to find out\
Now I need to stop my music running into nose dives\
Can't reduce to arrogance\
With white lies\
This city wants to raise me\
But I can't seem to see this\
How this dark city changed me\
It's all the same see\
Music is my life but\
Now I try to fight\
What ever I need to hide from\
North south east west\
London's my home now\
Knees week but we never slow down\
Now I start to do my music properly\
I'll stay away from all the negative shit\
That will follow me\
\
London calls me a stranger\
This is not my home\
I'm burning on the back street\
Stuck here sitting in the backseat\
I'm blazing on the street\
What I do isn't up to you\
And if the city never sleeps\
Then that makes two\
"Sunburn"\

You\'92re not her\
Though I try to see you differently\
I tow the line\
You see, I\'92m searching for what used to be mine\
\
I saw your eyes\
And then I saw her staring back at me\
And I will try to find another one\
Who suited me as well as her\
\
I've moved far away from you\
And I want to see you here beside me, dear\
But things aren\'92t clear\
\
When we never even tried\
We never even talked\
We never even thought in the long run\
Whenever it was painful\
Whenever I was away\
I\'92d miss you\
I miss you\
\
She was mine\
I was hers\
And all that\'92s in between\
If she would cry\
I would shelter her\
And keep her from the darkness that will be\
\
If I moved far away from you\
And I want to see you here beside me, dear\
But things aren\'92t clear\
\
We never even tried\
We never even talked\
We never even thought in the long run\
Whenever it was painful\
Whenever I was away\
I\'92d miss you\
And I miss you\
\
Don\'92t drop me in\
It\'92s not my turn\
If you cut deep\
Then I might learn\
If you scar and leave me\
Like a sunburn\
\
Don\'92t drop me in\
It\'92s not my turn\
If you cut deep\
Then I might learn\
You scarred and left me\
Like a sunburn\
\
We never even tried\
We never even talked\
We never even thought in the long run\
Whenever it was painful\
Whenever I was away\
I\'92d miss you\
I miss you\
\
"Where We Land"\
\
Treat me beneath this clear night sky\
And I will lie with you\
I start to feel those butterflies\
When I\'92m next to you\
\
Tell me your secrets\
Give me a friend\
Let all the good times flood in\
Do I love you?\
Do I hate you?\
I can\'92t make up my mind\
So let\'92s freefall\
See where we land\
\
It\'92s been this way since we were young\
We\'92ll fight and then make up\
I\'92ll breathe your air into my lungs\
When I feel your touch\
\
Tell me your secrets\
Give me a friend\
Let all the good times flood in\
Do I love you?\
Do I hate you?\
I can\'92t make up my mind\
So let\'92s freefall\
And see where we land\
\
\
"She"\
\
I paid all my dues\
And she wanted to know\
That I\'92d never leave her\
Now I\'92m ready to go\
And strange as it seems\
She\'92s endless to me\
She\'92s just like paperwork\
But harder to read\
\
Patience, my enemy\
And loving\'92s my friend\
It\'92s harder to leave\
With my heart on my sleeve\
Than to stay and just pretend\
Oh, she knows me so well\
Oh, she knows me like I know myself\
\
I made all my plans\
And she has made hers\
She kept me in mind\
But I wasn\'92t sure\
I searched every room\
For a way to escape\
But every time\
I tried to leave\
She keeps holding on to me\
For dear life\
And blocking my way\
\
Patience, my enemy\
And loving\'92s my friend\
It\'92s harder to leave\
With my heart on my sleeve\
Than to stay and just pretend\
Oh, she knows me so well\
Oh, she knows me like I know myself\
\
And like the back of her hand\
She already understands everything\
Won\'92t you stay?\
She says\
And she already knows how it goes\
And where she stands\
I\'92ll stay, anyway\
Cos she knows me so well\
Oh, she knows me like I know myself\
Oh, she knows me so well\
Oh, she knows me like I know myself\

\
"Fire Alarms"\
\
The rain wont stop falling\
It's harder than before\
This car keeps on stalling\
Pedal to the floor\
\
What I need to know\
Is if you love me and I \
Really need to know\
Is if you want me when you call\
If you want me when you call\
\
We were young and we were foolish\
School books in our arms\
Dodging homework, dodging classes\
To set off fire alarms\
\
And what I need to know\
Is if you love me and I\
Really need to know\
If you need me when you call\
If you want me when you call\
\
We are waving our lives away\
We are waving our lives away\
We are waving our lives away\
We are waving our lives away\
\
We are waving (and what I need to know)\
We are waving (is if you love me and I)\
We are waving (really need to know)\
We are waving (if you need me when you call)\
We are waving (what I need to know)\
We are waving (is if you love me an I)\
We are waving (really need to know)\
We are waving (if you need me when you call)\
\
What I need to know\
Is if you love me and I\
Really need to know\
If you need me when you call\
If you want me when you call\
\
"Fall"\
\
You and I\
Two of a mind\
This love\'92s\
One of a kind\
\
You and I\
We\'92re drifting\
Over the edge\
\
And I will fall for you\
And I will fall for you\
If I fall for you\
Would you fall too?\
\
You and I\
Learning to speak\
With kisses on cheeks\
\
You and I\
We\'92re lifted\
Over the edge\
\
And I will fall for you\
And I will fall for you\
If I fall for you\
Would you fall too?\
\
And I will fall for you\
And I will fall for you\
And if I fall for you\
Would you fall too?\
\
Would you fall too?\
Would you fall too?\
Would you fall too?\
Would you fall too?\
\
"Cold Coffee"\
\
She's like cold coffee in the morning\
I'm drunk off last nights whisky and coke\
She'll make me shiver without warning\
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke\
\
And you can stay with me forever\
Or you could stay with me for now\
\
Tell me if I'm wrong \
Tell me if I'm right\
Tell me if you need a loving hand\
To help you fall asleep tonight\
Tell me if I know\
Tell me if I do\
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to\
\
I'll wake with coffee in the morning\
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea\
Outside the day is up and calling\
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep\
\
Stay with me forever\
Or you could stay with me for now\
\
Tell me if I'm wrong\
Tell me if I'm right\
Tell me if you need a loving hand\
To help you fall asleep tonight\
Tell me if I know\
Tell me if I do\
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to\
\
'Cause I love the way you wake me up\
For goodness sake will my love not be enough?\
\
Tell me if I'm wrong\
Tell me if I'm right\
Tell me if you need a loving hand \
To help you fall asleep tonight\
Tell me if I know\
Tell me if I do\
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to\
\
Tell me if I'm wrong\
Tell me if I'm right\
Tell me if you need a loving hand\
To help you fall asleep tonight\
\
"Firefly"\
\
I fell in love next to you\
Burning fires in this room\
It just fits\
Light and smooth\
Like my feet in my shoes\
Little one, lie with me\
Sew your heart to my sleeve\
We'll stay quiet\
Underneath shooting stars\
If it helps you sleep\
\
And hold me tight\
Don't let me breathe\
Feeling like\
You won't believe\
\
[2x]\
There's a firefly\
Loose tonight\
Better catch it\
Before it burns this place down\
And I lie\
If I don't feel so right\
But the world looks better\
Through your eyes\
\
Teach my skin\
Those new tricks\
Warm me up\
With your lips\
Heart to heart\
Melt me down\
It's too cold\
In this town\
Close your eyes\
Lean on me\
Face to mouth\
Lips to cheek\
Feeling numb\
In my feet\
You're the one\
To help me get to sleep\
\
And hold me tight\
Don't let me breathe\
Feeling like\
You won't believe\
\
[2x]\
There's a firefly\
Loose tonight\
Better catch it\
Before it burns this place down\
And I lie\
If I don't feel so right\
But the world looks better\
Through your eyes\
\
It's only been\
One night of love\
And maybe\
That is not enough\
\
Hold me tight\
Don't let me breathe\
Feeling like\
You won't believe\
\
It's only been\
One night of love\
And maybe\
That is not enough\
\
Hold me tight\
Don't let me breathe\
Feeling like\
You won't believe\
\
[2x]\
There's a firefly loose tonight\
Better catch it\
Before it burns this place down\
And I lie\
If I don't feel so right\
But the world looks better\
Through your eyes\
\
"One Night"\
\
Lying in a bedroom\
Lighting up a Benson\
Face hair is growing\
So I cut it with a vengeance\
Hey, did I mention\
As she makes an entrance\
Said I had a tendency\
To finish off a sentence\
\
Oh well, she\'92s a local girl\
No make-up\
Cause she knows me well\
Hair tied up in elastic band\
With a kiss on the cheek\
For her one-night man\
\
Is it fast food?\
I\'92ll regret it after\
And I needed money\
But I\'92m too shy to ask her\
So she buys me chips and cheese\
And I tell her that I love her\
And she\'92s all I need\
I take it with a cold glass\
Of the fruit and the barley\
She\'92s still a sucker for the\
Apple and Bacardi\
Heading to the party\
Sitting in the car seat\
B.E.P. on radio\
It makes me feel naughty and lastly\
\
She knows me well\
Bit of a catch\
To have a local girl\
Hair tied up in elastic band\
With a kiss on the cheek\
For her one-night man\
\
I don\'92t wanna go alone\
I don\'92t wanna go alone\
No, I don't wanna go alone\
\
Tell her that I love her\
Tell her that I need her\
Tell her that she\'92s more than a one-night stand\
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair\
All I wanna do is be near\
\
Tell her that I want her\
Tell her that I need her\
Tell her that she\'92s more than a one-night stand\
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else\
If you don\'92t, I\'92ll tell her myself\
\
And we\'92ve got that love in us\
So if the drink kill us\
We\'92re gonna dance all night\
Till the floor fillers\
If we talk outside\
Say I hate wasps too\
I don\'92t really dance\
So I\'92ll just watch you\
Are you taking me back tonight?\
Tell me if that\'92s alright\
I don\'92t wanna be here\
I\'92m not the sofa type\
Tell me if you have a toothbrush\
You don\'92t mind sharing\
She said I wanna take off\
What you\'92re wearing\
\
And I don\'92t wanna go alone\
I don\'92t wanna go alone\
I don\'92t wanna go alone, oh.\
\
Tell her that I love her\
Tell her that I need her\
Tell her that she\'92s more than a one-night stand\
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair\
All I wanna do is be near\
\
Tell her that I want her\
Tell her that I need her\
Tell her that she\'92s more than a one-night stand\
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else\
If you don\'92t, I\'92ll tell her myself\
\
She\'92s like the fast food\
I\'92ll regret it after\
And I needed money\
But I\'92m too shy to ask her\
But she buys me chips and cheese\
So I tell her that she\'92s all I need\
\
Tell her that I\
Tell her that I\
Tell her that she\'92s more than a one-night stand\
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair\
All I wanna do is be near\
\
Tell her that I\
Tell her that I\
Tell her that she\'92s more than a one-night stand\
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else\
If you don\'92t, I\'92ll tell her myself\
\
Now tell her that I love her\
Tell her that I need her\
That she\'92s more than a one-night stand\
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair\
All I wanna do is be near\
\
Tell her that I want her\
Tell her that I need her\
Tell her that she\'92s more than a one-night stand\
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else\
If you don\'92t, I\'92ll tell her myself\
\
"Sofa"\
\
She\'92s reinventing loving me\
When we\'92re resembling cutlery on the sofa\
It must have been about 5.01\
Like my blue ripped jeans\
And my eyes are closed\
And I\'92m way too tired\
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire\
On the sofa, where we lay\
I wanna stay inside all day\
And it\'92s cold outside, again\
\
And we\'92re both so high\
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica\
We can go where you want\
Say the word and I\'92ll take ya\
But I\'92d rather stay on the sofa\
On the sofa, with you\
\
When the morning comes\
We\'92re not watching Formula I\
It\'92s not what we breathe for\
So kick off the day with Friends on T4\
Two, boiled and brew\
Two sugars ain\'92t too sweet for you\
On the sofa, where we lay\
I wanna stay inside all day\
And it\'92s cold outside, again\
And we\'92re still so high\
\
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica\
We can go where you want\
Say the word and I\'92ll take ya\
But I\'92d rather stay on the sofa\
On the sofa, with you\
\
And it feels like I\'92m flying\
And it feels like\
We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica\
Through the streets of New York\
That is where I will take ya\
Paris, Rome, to Rio\
Passing through Las Vegas\
We can go where you want\
Say the word, and I\'92ll take ya\
But I\'92d rather stay on the sofa\
On the sofa\
On the sofa, with you\
\
"Little Bird"\
\
If we take this bird in\
With its broken leg\
We could nurse it\
She said\
Come inside\
For a little lie down with me\
If you fall asleep\
It wouldn\'92t be the worst thing\
\
But when I wake up\
Your make-up is on my shoulder\
And tell me, if I lie down\
Would you stay now\
And let me hold you?\
\
But if I kissed you\
Will your mouth read this truth?\
Darling, how I miss you\
Strawberries taste how lips do\
And it\'92s not complete yet\
Mustn\'92t get our feet wet\
'Cause that leads to regret\
Diving in too soon\
And I\'92ll owe it all to you\
My little bird\
My little bird\
\
If we take a walk out\
In the morning dew\
We could lay down\
So I\'92m next to you\
Come inside\
For a little home-made tea\
If you fall asleep\
Then at least you\'92re next to me\
\
And if I wake up\
You see, it\'92s late, love\
Go back to sleep\
I\'92m covered by nature\
And I\'92m safe now\
Underneath this oak tree\
With you beside me\
\
But if I kissed you\
Will your mouth read this truth?\
Darling, how I miss you\
Strawberries taste how lips do\
And it\'92s not complete yet\
Mustn\'92t get our feet wet\
'Cause that leads to regret\
Diving in too soon\
And I\'92ll owe it all to you\
My little bird\
My little bird\
My little bird\
My little bird\
\
And of all these things\
I\'92m sure of\
I\'92m not quite certain\
Of your love\
And you made me scream\
But then I made you cry\
When I left that little bird\
With its broken leg to die\
\
But if I kissed you\
Will your mouth read this truth?\
Darling, how I miss you\
Strawberries taste how lips do\
And it\'92s not complete yet\
Mustn\'92t get our feet wet\
'Cause that leads to regret\
Diving in too soon\
But I\'92ll owe it all to you\
My little bird\
My little bird whoa oh oh\
My little bird\
My little bird\
You\'92re my little bird\
\
\
"Homeless"\
\
Mmm...\
Whoa oh...\
\
Could I wake up next to you\
When it's hitting double figures\
Look into your eyes\
Like I'm looking into double mirrors\
Could you make it any clearer\
Everything's such a blur\
It's not my turn\
It's hers to get hurt\
On a late night\
Coming home from way too many train rides\
Lace not as red as my face\
I'm home at the same time\
Highbury estate's fine\
Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines\
\
Hey....\
\
I haven't slept for the past week\
Two hours ain't enough for me\
I feel inspired, at quarter to three AM\
I haven't changed since our last meet\
I'm still getting all my meals for free\
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again\
\
'Cause it's not a homeless life for me\
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\
And it's not a homeless life for me\
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\
And it's not a homeless life for me\
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\
And it's not a homeless life for me yeah...\
\
And now I'm sitting on a night bus\
Flicking through my iPod\
Feeling kinda tired\
So I try to close my eyes up\
Driver, turn the lights off\
Lights on, on stage, mics on\
Song plays, nice one\
Gotta keep my hype strong\
Truth be, never went to Uni\
People see right through me\
but I'm not a fool, see\
I'm never gonna do one\
Gonna live past 22, done\
Everything I need to\
Except get a 2:1\
\
I haven't slept for the past week\
Two hours ain't enough for me\
I feel inspired, at quarter to three AM\
I haven't changed since our last meet\
I'm still getting all my meals for free\
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again\
\
'Cause it's not a homeless life for me\
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\
And it's not a homeless life for me\
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\
And it's not a homeless life for me\
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\
And it's not a homeless life for me yeah...\
\
\
When I feel cold\
You keep me warm\
And I'm not looking for some loose change\
Just wanna find a true mate\
Who wants to be my duvet hey-eh\
\
It's not a homeless life for me\
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be\
\
And it's not a homeless life for me\
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be [6x]\
And it's not a homeless life for me Yeah...mm..oh.\

"The A Team"\
\
White lips, pale face\
Breathing in snowflakes\
Burnt lungs, sour taste\
Light's gone, day's end\
Struggling to pay rent\
Long nights, strange men\
\
And they say\
She's in the Class A Team\
Stuck in her daydream\
Been this way since eighteen\
But lately her face seems\
Slowly sinking, wasting\
Crumbling like pastries\
And they scream\
The worst things in life come free to us\
'Cause we're just under the upper hand\
And go mad for a couple grams\
And she don't want to go outside tonight\
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\
Or sells love to another man\
It's too cold outside\
For angels to fly\
Angels to fly\
\
Ripped gloves, raincoat\
Tried to swim and stay afloat\
Dry house, wet clothes\
Loose change, bank notes\
Weary-eyed, dry throat\
Call girl, no phone\
\
And they say\
She's in the Class A Team\
Stuck in her daydream\
Been this way since eighteen\
But lately her face seems\
Slowly sinking, wasting\
Crumbling like pastries\
And they scream\
The worst things in life come free to us\
'Cause we're just under the upper hand\
And go mad for a couple grams\
And she don't want to go outside tonight\
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland\
Or sells love to another man\
It's too cold outside\
For angels to fly\
An angel will die\
Covered in white\
Closed eye\
And hoping for a better life\
This time, we'll fade out tonight\
Straight down the line\
\
And they say\
She's in the Class A Team\
Stuck in her daydream\
Been this way since eighteen\
But lately her face seems\
Slowly sinking, wasting\
Crumbling like pastries\
They scream\
The worst things in life come free to us\

Go mad for a couple grams\
And we don't want to go outside tonight\
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland\

Angels to fly\
To fly, fly\
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly\
For angels to die\
\
"Drunk"\
\
I wanna be drunk when I wake up\
On the right side of the wrong bed\
And never an excuse I made up\
Tell you the truth I hate\
What didn't kill me,\
It never made me stronger at all\
Love will scar your make up\
Lips sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there\
I'm sat here wishing I was sober\
I know I'll never hold you like I used to\
\
But a house gets cold when you cut the heating\
Without you to hold I'll be freezing\
Can't rely on my heart to beat in\
'Cause you take parts of it every evening\
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing\
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me? '\
\
Should I? Should I?\
Maybe I'll get drunk again\
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again\
To feel a little love\
\
I wanna hold your heart in both hands\
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can\
And I got no plans for the weekend, so should we speak then?\
Keep it between friends\
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to\
\
There may be other people like us\
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up\
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before\
And you don't hold me anymore\
\
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name\
I know I can't heal things with a handshake\
You know I can change, as I began saying\
You cut me wide open like landscape\
Open bottles of beer but never champagne\
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make\
\
Should I? Should I?\
Maybe I'll get drunk again\
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again\
To feel a little love\
\
All by myself, I'm here again\
All by myself, you know I'll never change\
All by myself\
All by myself\
\
I'm just drunk again\
I'll be drunk again\
I'll be drunk again\
To feel a little love\
\
"UNI"\
\
I found your hair band on my bedroom floor\
The only evidence that you'd been here before\
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore\
They're more like tsunami tides\
In my eyes\
Never getting dry,\
So I get high,\
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on\
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye\
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night\
\
I don't drink like everybody else\
I do it to forget things about myself\
Stumble and fall\
With the head spin I got,\
My mind's with you but my heart's just not\
\
So am I close to you anymore if it's over?\
And there's no chance that we'll work it out\
\
That's why you and I ended over U N I\
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied\
You and I ended over U N I\
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied\
\
Everybody said we'd be together forever,\
But I know that I never wanna settle down,\
Come around, break up the love like Lego now\
Never wanna turn into another like you\
Sleep with my thoughts\
And I dance with my views\
Everything's great, not everything's sure,\
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus\
Now I'm in a position to be another stalker\
Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward\
Like our last kiss. It was perfect,\
But we were nervous on the surface\
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it,\
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts\
I forget like an elephant\
Or we can use a sedative\
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss\
\
So am I close to you anymore if it's over?\
And there's no chance that we'll work it out\
\
You and I ended over U N I\
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied\
You and I ended over U N I\
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied\
\
Wo-ooooahhhh [2x] oohh ohh\
\
Because if I was gonna go somewhere,\
I'd be there by now\
And maybe I can let myself down\
And I'm thinking that I'm unaware,\
I keep my feet on the ground\
And keep looking around\
To make sure I'm not the only one to feel low\
\
Because if you want,\
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered\
From all that I've done wrong\
And I know you'll say\
That I'm the only one,\
But I know God made another one of me to love you better than I ever will\
\
'Cause you and I ended over U N I\
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied\
You and I ended over U N I\
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied\

"Grade 8"\
\
My mind is a warrior,\
My heart is a foreigner,\
My eyes are the colour of red like a sunset,\
I'll never keep it bottled up\
And left to the hands of the coroner,\
Be a true heart not a follower,\
We're not done yet.\
\
And I see it in your movements tonight,\
If we should ever do this right,\
I'm never gonna let you down,\
Oh I'll never let you down,\
Now keep it on the down low\
And I'll keep you around so I'll know\
That I'll never let you down,\
I'll never let you down.\
\
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,\
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,\
Now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,\
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,\
\
Now, my eyes are a river filler,\
This drink is a liver killer,\
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again,\
Your body is my ballpoint pen\
And your mind is my new best friend,\
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again,\
\
Now I see it in your movements tonight,\
If we should ever do this right,\
I'm never gonna let you down,\
Oh I'll never let you down,\
We'll keep it on the down low\
And I'll keep you around so I'll know\
That I'll never let you down,\

Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll never let you down [x4]\

'Cause You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,\
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,\

"Wake Me Up"\
\
I should ink my skin with your name\
And take my passport out again\
And just replace it\
See I could do without a tan\
On my left hand,\
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle\
And I should run you a hot bath\
And fill it up with bubbles\
\
'Cause maybe you're loveable\
And maybe you're my snowflake\
And your eyes turn from green to gray\
In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place\
And you should never cut your hair\
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder\
\
And you will never know\
Just how beautiful you are to me\
But maybe I'm just in love\
When you wake me up\
\
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?\
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?\
And I know you love Shrek\
\'91Cause we've watched it 12 times\
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too\
And if your DVD breaks today\
You should've got a VCR\
Because I've never owned a Blue ray, true say\
\
And now I always been shit at computer games\
And your brother always beats me\
And if I lost, I\'92d go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV\
And then you\'92d laugh at me\
And be asking me\
If I'm gonna be home next week\
And then you'd lie with me 'til I fall asleep\
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets\
\
And you will never know\
Just how beautiful you are to me\
But maybe I'm just in love\
When you wake me up\
\
And I think you hate the smell of smoke\
You always try to get me to stop\
But you drink as much as me\
And I get drunk a lot\
So I'll take you to the beach\
And walk along the sand\
And I'll make you a heart pendant\
With a pebble held in my hand\
And I'll carve it like a necklace\
So the heart falls where your chest is\
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach\
And it falls just where it needs to be\
And rests peacefully\
So you just need to breathe\
To feel my heart against yours now, against yours now\
\
\'91Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up\
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up\
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up\

"Small Bump"\
\
\
You're just a small bump unborn, in four months you're brought to life,\
You might be left with my hair, but you'll have your mother's eyes,\
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can,\
But for now you're scan of my unmade plans,\
[album version:] A small bump in four months you're brought to life\
[acoustic version:] A small bump in four months you'll open your eyes\
\
\
[album version:] I'll whisper quietly, I'll give you nothing but truth,\
[acoustic version:] I'll hold you tightly, I'll give you nothing but truth,\
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you\
\
\
You are my one and only.\
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\
Oh, you are my one and only.\
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\
And you'll be alright.\
\
\
Oh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin.\
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin.\
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice,\
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide\
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes.\
\
\
[album version:] And I'll hold you tightly, I'll tell you nothing but truth,\
[acoustic version:] And I'll hold you tightly, I'll give you nothing but truth,\
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you\
\

You are my one and only.\
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\
Oh, you are my one and only.\
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\
And you'll be alright.\
\
\
And you can lie with me,\
With your tiny feet\
When you're half asleep,\
I'll leave you be.\
Right in front of me\
For a couple weeks\
So I can keep you safe.\
\
\
'Cause you are my one and only.\
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\
You are my one and only.\
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.\
And you'll be alright.\
\
\
'Cause you were just a small bump unborn for four months then torn from life.\
Maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why.\

"This"\
\
This is the start of something beautiful\
This is the start of something new\
You are the one who'd make me lose it all\
You are the start of something new, ooh\
\
And I'll throw it all away\
And watch you fall into my arms again\
And I'll throw it all away\
Watch you fall, now\
\
You are the earth that I will stand upon\
You are the words that I will sing\
\
And I've thrown it all away\
And watched you fall into his arms again\
And I've thrown it all away\
Watched you fall, now\
\
And take me back\
Take me home\
Watch me fall\
Down to earth\
Take me back for\
\
This is the start of something beautiful\
You are the start of something new\

"The City"\
\
This city never sleeps\
I hear the people walk by when it\'92s late\
Sirens bleed through my windowsill\
I can\'92t close my eyes\
Don\'92t control what I\'92m into\
And this tower is alive\
The lights that blind keep me awake\
Hood up and lace untied\
The sleep fills my mind\
Can't control what I\'92m into\
\
London calls me a stranger, a traveller\
This is now my home, my home\
\
I\'92m burning on the back street\
Stuck here sitting in the backseat\
I\'92m blazing on the street\
What I do isn\'92t up to you\
If the city never sleeps\
Then that makes two\
\
The pavement is my friend\
It will take me where I need to go\
I find it trips me up\
And puts me down\
This is not what I\'92m used to\
The shop across the road\
Fills my needs and gives me company\
When I need it\
Voices speak through my walls\
I don\'92t think I\'92m gonna make it\
Past tomorrow\
\
London calls me a stranger, a traveller\
This is now my home, my home\
\
I\'92m burning on the back street\
Stuck here sitting in the backseat\
I\'92m blazing on the street\
What I do isn\'92t up to you\
If the city never sleeps\
Then that makes two\
\
And my lungs hurt\
And my ears bled\
With the sound of the city life\
Echoed in my head\
Do I need this to keep me alive?\
The traffic stops and starts\
But I need to move along\
\
London calls me a stranger\
This is not my home, home\
\
I\'92m burning on the back street\
Stuck here sitting in the backseat\
I\'92m blazing on the street\
What I do isn\'92t up to you\
And if the city never sleeps\
Then that makes two\

"Lego House"\
\
I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a Lego house\
If things go wrong we can knock it down\
My three words have two meanings but there's one thing on my mind\
It's all for you\
\
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm\
If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now\
\
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love\
I'll pick you up when you're getting down\
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now\
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind\
I'll do it all for you in time\
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now, now\
\
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and colour you in\
If things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall\
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before\
Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours\
\
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love\
I'll pick you up when you're getting down\
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now\
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind\
I'll do it all for you in time\
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now\
\
Don't hold me down, I think the braces are breaking and it's more than I can take\
\
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm\
If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now\
\
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love\
I'll pick you up when you're getting down\
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now\
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind,\

Settle down with me\
Cover me up\
Cuddle me in\

Lie down with me\
And hold me in your arms\

And your heart's against my chest, your lips pressed to my neck\
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet\
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now\
\
Kiss me like you wanna be loved\
You wanna be loved\
You wanna be loved\
This feels like falling in love\
Falling in love\
We're falling in love\
\
Settle down with me\
And I'll be your safety\
You'll be my lady\
\
I was made to keep your body warm\
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms\
\
Oh no\
My heart's against your chest, your lips pressed to my neck\
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet\
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now\

Kiss me like you wanna be loved\
You wanna be loved\
You wanna be loved\
This feels like falling in love\
Falling in love\
We're falling in love\

Yeah I've been feeling everything\
From hate to love\
From love to lust\
From lust to truth\
I guess that's how I know you\
So I hold you close to help you give it up\
\
So kiss me like you wanna be loved\
You wanna be loved\
You wanna be loved\
This feels like falling in love\
Falling in love\
We're falling in love\

Of all the money that e'er I had\
I've spent it in good company\
And all the harm that e'er I've done\
Alas it was to none but me\
And all I've done for want of with\
To memory now I can't recall\
So fill to me the parting glass\
Good night and joy be with you all\
\
Of all the comrades that e'er I had\
They are sorry for my going away\
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had\
They would wish me one more day to stay\
But since it falls unto my lot\
That I should rise and you should not\
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call\
Good night and joy be with you all\
\
A man may drink and not be drunk\
A man may fight and not be slain\
A man may court a pretty girl\
And perhaps be welcomed back again\
But since it has so ought to be\
By a time to rise and a time to fall\
Come fill to me the parting glass\
Good night and joy be with you all\
Good night and joy be with you all\

Another mind, another soul\
Another body to grow old\
It's not complicated\

Float down\
Like autumn leaves\
And hush now\
Close your eyes before the sleep\
And you're miles away\
And yesterday you were here with me\

Another tear, another cry\
Another place for us to die\
It's not complicated\
\
Another love that's gone to waste\
Another light lost from your face\
It's complicated\

Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?\
Float down\
Like autumn leaves\
And hush now\
Close your eyes before the sleep\
And you're miles away\
And yesterday you were here with me\

Ooh how I miss you\
My symphony played the song that carried you out\
Ooh how I miss you\

She left a note "I'll be back in 5"\
Well, I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive, hey\

But it won't hold me like you do\

Smoking on a roll up\

"Make It Rain"\
\
When the sins of my father\
Weigh down in my soul\
And the pain of my mother\
Will not let me go\
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky\
To refine the purest of kings\
And even though\
I know this fire brings me pain\
Even so\
And just the same\
\
Make it rain\
Make it rain down, Lord\
Make it rain\
Oh, make it rain\
Make it rain\
Make it rain down, Lord\
Make it rain\
Make it rain\
\
All seed needs the water\
Before it grows out of the ground\
But it just keeps on getting hard\
And the hunger more profound\
Well, I know there can come tears from the eyes\
But they may as well all be in vain\
Even though\
I know these tears come with pain\
Even so\
And just the same\
\
Make it rain\
Make it rain down, Lord\
Make it rain\
Oh, make it rain\
Make it rain\
Make it rain down, Lord\
Make it rain\
Make it rain\
\
And the seas are full of water\
That stops by the shore\
Just like the riches of grandeur\
That never reach the poor\
\
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause\
And let lightning be the veins\
And fill the sky\
With all that they can drop\
When it's time\
To make a change\
\
Make it rain\
Make it rain down, Lord\
Make it rain\
Make it rain\
Make it rain\
Make it rain down, Lord\
Make it rain\
Oh, Make it rain\
Make it rain?\
Make it rain?\

Oh, Make it rain\

Make it rain down, Lord\
Make it vain\
Oh, Make it rain\

Make in vain\

Tell me that you turned down the man\
Who asked for your hand\
'Cause you're waiting for me\
And I know, you're gonna be away a while\
But I've got no plans at all to leave\
\
And would you take away my hopes and dreams and just stay with me?\
\
All my senses come to life\
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I\
Have ever been and I'll never leave again\
'Cause you are the only one\
And all my friends have gone to find\
Another place to let their hearts collide\

'Cause you are the only one\
\
Take my hand and my\
Heart and soul, I will\
Only have these eyes for you\
And you know, everything changes but\
We'll be strangers if we see this through\
You could stay within these walls and bleed\
Or just stay with me\
Oh lord, now\

I listen to sad songs, singing about love\

Have ever been and I'll never leave again\

Inside out\
Searching for a sweet surrender\
But this is not the end\
I can't work it out\
How going through the motions\
Going through us\
And oh I've known it for the longest time\
And all of my hopes\
All of my own words\

See the flames inside my eyes\
It burns so bright I wanna' feel your love\
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar\
But for tonight I wanna' fall in love\
Put your faith in my stomach\

I messed up this time\
Late last night\
Drinking to suppress devotion\
With fingers intertwined\
I can't shake this feeling now\
We're going through the motions\
Hoping you'd stop\
\
And ohhh I've only caused you pain\
I know but all of my words will always below\
Of all the love you spoke\
When you're on my road\
Walking me home\

See the flames inside my eyes\
It burns so bright I wanna' feel your love\

Glass on the side\

Ignoring everybody here\
We wish they would disappear\
So maybe we could get down now\

This love is a blaze\
I saw flames from the side of the stage\
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days\
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know\
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke\
Let it go until our roads are changed\
Singing we found love in a local rave\
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say\
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray\
I told her my name and said, "It's nice to meet ya."\
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila.\
I already know she's a keeper\
Just from this one small act of kindness,\
I'm in deep shit if anybody finds out\
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now, not\
Sobering up we just sit on the couch\
One thing led to another\
Now she's kissing my mouth\

\
Ah lahmlahlah\
Ah lahmlahlah\
\
[Verse 1:]\
I met this girl late last year\
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear."\
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake\
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait\
But then I jump right in\
A week later returned\
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn\
But I gave her my time for two or three nights\
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right\
I went away for months until our paths crossed again\
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend."\
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10:00\
Baby, bring a lemon and a bottle of gin\
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM\
Baby, if you wanted me then you should've just said\
She's singing\
Ah lahmlahlah\
\
[Chorus:]\
Don't fuck with my love\
That heart is so cold\
All over my home\
I don't wanna know that babe\
Ah lahmlahlah\
Don't fuck with my love\
I told her she knows\
Take aim and reload\
I don't wanna know that babe\
Ah lahmlahlah\
\
[Verse 2:]\
For a couple weeks I\
Only wanna see her\
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza\
Before a text message was the only way to reach her\
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her\
Singing out Aretha\
All over the track like a feature\
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either\
But me and her we make money the same way\
Four cities, two planes the same day\
And those shows have never been what it's about\
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out\
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch\
But we should get on a plane\
Or we'll be missing it now\
Wish I'd have written it down\
The way that things played out\
When she was kissing him\
How? I was confused about\
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing\
Ah lahmlahlah\
\
[Chorus:]\
Don't fuck with my love\
That heart is so cold\
All over my home\
I don't wanna know that babe\
Ah lahmlahlah\
Don't fuck with my love\
I told her she knows\
Take aim and reload\
I don't wanna know that babe\
Ah lahmlahlah\
\
[Verse 3:]\
[Knock knock knock] on my hotel door\
I don't even know if she knows what for\
She was crying on my shoulder\
I already told ya\
Trust and respect is what we do this for\
I never intended to be next\
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all\
And I never saw him as a threat\
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course\
It's not like we were both on tour\
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor\
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment\
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different\
This is not the way you realize what you wanted\
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest\
All this time God knows I'm singing\
Ah lahmlahlah\
\
[Chorus 2x:]\
Don't fuck with my love\
That heart is so cold\
All over my home\
I don't wanna know that babe\
Ah lahmlahlah\
Don't fuck with my love\
I told her she knows\
Take aim and reload\
I don't wanna know that babe\

\cf2 "Nina"\
\
I met you when I was a teen\
But then you were one as well\
And I could play a guitar\
Just like ringing a bell\
Sometimes I wonder\
In any other summer\
Could you have been a part time lover to me\
Listening to Stevie Wonder\
Under the covers where we used to lay\
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers played\
I'd be on tour almost every day\
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay\
\
Just watching a dvd, smoking illegal weed\
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe\
We'd use each other's air just for the people to see\
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep\
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us\
And I'll say you were beautiful without your make up\
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause\
We can all be loved the way that God made us\
And time's the only reason that we could break up\
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much\
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake\
So say it again\
\
Oh Nina, you should go Nina\
Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina\
Oh won't you leave me now\
And I've been livin' on the road Nina\
But then again you should know Nina\
Cause that's you and me both Nina\
Oh won't you leave me now, now\
\
And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie\
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold\
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own\
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone\
Watching blue planet, creating new habits\
Acting as if we were two rabbits\
And then you'd vanish\
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics\
I'd disappear, you'd call me selfish\
I understand but I can't help it\
I put my job over everything except my family and friends\
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back\
Overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications\
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break\
Just revaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late\
So we can either deal with the pain and wait to get on a plane\
But in a day we'll have to say it again\
\
Oh Nina, you should go Nina\
Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina\
Oh won't you leave me now\
And I've been livin' on the road Nina\
But then again you should know Nina\
Cause that's you and me both Nina\
Oh won't you leave me now, now\
\
Love will come and love will go\
But you can make it on your own\
Sing that song\
Go oh won't you leave me now\
People grow and fall apart\
But you can mend your broken heart\
Take it back go oh won't you leave me now\
\
Oh Nina, you should go Nina (Love will come and Love will go)\
Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina (But you can make it on your own)\
Oh won't you leave me now (Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)\
And I've been livin' on the road Nina (People grow and fall apart)\
But then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart)\
Cause that's you and me both Nina (Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)\
Oh won't you leave me now\

Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine\
Disappearing all night\
I don\'92t wanna know where he\'92s been lying\
I know what I wanna do\
Wanna run away, run away with you\
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning go\
\
How long you leaving?\
Well, dad, just don\'92t expect me back this evening\
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this\
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but\
\
I love him from my skin to my bones\
But I don\'92t wanna live in his home\
There\'92s nothing to say 'cause he knows\
I\'92ll just run away and be on my own\
\
I\'92ve never seen my dad cry\
Cold as stone in the kitchen light\
I\'92ll tell you it\'92s about time\
But I was raised to keep quiet\
This is what I\'92m gonna do\
Gonna run away, gonna make that move\
Gonna grab clothes and when it\'92s morning go\
How long you leaving?\

Gonna take my things and go\
If things change in a matter of days\
I could be persuaded to hold on\
Mama was the same\
None of us are saints I guess that god knows that\
I don\'92t wanna run away\
And one of these days I might just show that\
Put my home in a suitcase\
Tie both shoe laces and hope that\
Things change, but for now I\'92ll leave town with a backpack on my shoulder\

I love him from my skin to my bones\
But I don\'92t wanna live in his home\
There\'92s nothing to say 'cause he knows\
I\'92ll just run away and be on my own\
\
\
"The Man"\
\
No, I don't wanna hate you\
Just wish you'd never gone for the man\
And waited two weeks at least\
Before you let him take you\
I stayed true\
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school\
He's waiting for the time to move\
I knew he had his eyes on you\
He's not the right guy for you\
Don't hate me cause I write the truth\
No I would never lie to you\
But it was never fine to lose you\
And what a way to find out\
It never came from my mouth\
You never changed your mind\
But you were just afraid to mind out\
But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it\
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing\
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me\
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep\
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually\
You're practically my family\
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be\
But tragically our love just lost the will to live\
But would I kill to give it one more shot\
I think not\
\
I don't love you baby\
I don't need you baby\
I don't want you no\
Anymore\
\
I don't love you baby\
I don't need you baby\
I don't wanna love you no\
Anymore\
\
Recently I tend to zone out\
Up in my headphones to Holocene\
You promised your body but I'm away so much\
I stay more celibate than in a monastery\
I'm not cut out for life on the road\
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much\
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me\
I guess I'm not the man that you need\
Ever since you went to uni\
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack\
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad\
But when I broke the industry\
That's when I broke your heart\
I was supposed to chart and celebrate\
But good things are over fast\
I know it's hard to deal with and see this\
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features\
Then I turn the music off\
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus\
I never really want to believe this\
Got advice from my dad and he\
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need\
I guess I'm unaware of it\
Success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with\
\
I don't love you baby\
I don't need you baby\
I don't want you no\
Anymore\
\
I don't love you baby\
I don't need you baby\
I don't wanna love you no\
Anymore\
\
And since you left\
I've given up my days off\
It's what I need to stay strong\
I know you have a day job\
But mine is 24/7\
I feel like writing a book\
I guess I lied in the hook\
Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could\
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist\
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid\
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink\
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's\
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill\
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27\
I'll die from a thrill\
Go down in history as just a wasted talent\
Can I face the challenge\
Or did I make a mistake erasing?\
It's only therapy\
My thoughts just get ahead of me\
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be\
Either way I guess I'm not prepared\
But I'll say this\
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit\
Take my apology\
I'm sorry for the honesty\
But I had to get this off my chest\
\
I don't love you baby\
I don't need you baby\
I don't want you no\
Anymore\
\
I don't love you baby\
I don't need you baby\
I don't wanna love you no\
Anymore\
\
\
"Thinking Out Loud"\
\
When your legs don't work like they used to before\
And I can't sweep you off of your feet\
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?\
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?\
\
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70\
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23\
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\
Maybe just the touch of a hand\
Well, me\'97I fall in love with you every single day\
And I just wanna tell you I am\
\
So, honey, now\
Take me into your loving arms\
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars\
Place your head on my beating heart\
I'm thinking out loud\
Maybe we found love right where we are\
\
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades\
And the crowds don't remember my name\
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)\
I know you will still love me the same\
\
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen\
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory\
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways\
Maybe it's all part of a plan\
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes\
Hoping that you'll understand\
\
That, baby, now\
Take me into your loving arms\
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars\
Place your head on my beating heart\
Thinking out loud\
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)\
\
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud\
\
So, baby, now\
Take me into your loving arms\
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars\
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart\
I'm thinking out loud\
But maybe we found love right where we are\
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are\
And we found love right where we are\
\
\
"Afire Love"\
\
Things were all good yesterday\
And then the devil took your memory\
And if you fell to your death today\
I hope that heaven is your resting place\
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain\
But then that could have been the medicine\
And now you're lying in the bed again\
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them\
\
My father told me, son\
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face\
You're not the only one\
Although my grandma used to say\
He used to sing\
\
Darlin' hold me in your arms\
The way you did last night\
And we'll die inside\
For a little while here oh\
\
I could look into your eyes\
Until the sun comes up\
And we're wrapped in light and life and love\
Put your open lips on mine\
And slowly let them shut\
For they're designed to be together oh\
With your body next to mine\
Our hearts will beat as one\
And we set alight\
We're afire love\
\
Love, love\
\
Things were all good yesterday\
Then the devil took your breath away\
Now we're left here in the pain\
Black suit black tie standing in the rain\
And now my family is one again\
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend\
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen\
Six years old I remember when\
\
My father told me, son\
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face\
You're not the only one\
Although my grandma used to say\
He used to sing\
\
Darlin' hold me in your arms\
The way you did last night\
And we'll die inside\
For a little while here oh\
\
I could look into your eyes\
Until the sun comes up\
And we're wrapped in light and life and love\
Put your open lips on mine\
And slowly let them shut\
For they're designed to be together oh\
With your body next to mine\
Our hearts will beat as one\
And we're set alight\
We're afire love\
\
Love, love\
\
See the love, the love, the love, the love [3x]\
\
My father and all of my family\
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah\
And my mother and all of my family\
Rise from their seats to say hallelujah\
And my brother and all of my family\
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah\
(To my brother and my sister, yeah, ah)\
My father and all of my family\
Rise from their seats to sing\
Hallelujah\
\
To the love, the love, the love, the love\
\
\
"Take It Back"\
\
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow\
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know\
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in\
I never want to get bitten\
Cause plagiarism is hidden\
Watch how I sit on the rhythm\
Prisoner with a vision\
Signs of a label\
But didn't listen to any criticism\
Thought you knew but you didn't\
So perk your ears up and listen\
Studio is a system\
And you could say that I'm driven\
And now it's onto the next saga\
We drink the best lager\
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather\
I do my own thing now\
And get respect after\
And I'm avoiding the 'caine\
Like it was Get Carter\
For four years I never had a place to stay\
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded\
Like a paper weight\
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home\
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked\
Went from sleeping at a subway station\
To sleeping with a movie star\
And adding to the population\
Not my imagination\
I don't wanna relax\
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?\
I take it back now\
\
Mmmm come on and take it back love\
Come on and take it back for us\
Don't you fade into the back love\
No\
\
I take it back with the rhythm and blues\
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news\
Tryin' act like Jack Black\
When I bring it to school\
I make a beat with my feet\
By just hittin' the loop\
Bringing the lyrics to prove\
That I can fit in these shoes\
I give you the truth through the vocal booth\
And stars burst out on the scene\
Like an opal fruit\
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot\
But then again that's what they're supposed to do\
And I'm supposed to be calm\
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm\
Whispering everything that happens\
Is from now on\
I'll be ready to start again\
By the end of the song\
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong\
But then I've never had an enemy\
Except the NME but I'll be selling\
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be\
With only spectacles ahead of me\
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree\
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids\
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic\
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it\
This song's from the heart cover the planet\
I take it back now\
\
Mmmm come on and take it back love\
Come on and take it back for us\
Don't you fade into the back love\
No\
And take it back now\
\
Now I don't ever wanna be perfect\
Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless\
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed\
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus\
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton\
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless\
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition\
'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written\
Now absence can make your heart ache\
But drinking absinth can change your mind state\
Vividly need to let my liver be\
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends\
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me\
And I hope to see him blowing up globally\
'Cause that how it's supposed to be\
I'm screaming out vocally\
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams\
But, but I just write schemes\
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans\
Madison Square Garden is where I might be\
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out\
It's time to take it back now\
\
Mmmm come on and take it back love\
Come on and take it back for us\
Don't you fade into the back love\
No\
\
Mmm come on and take it back love\
Come on and take it back for us\
Don't you fade into the back love\
No\
\
[Album version stops here]\
\
My dreams keep me awake at night\
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype\
Am I just living the lie\
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa\
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me\
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake\
But the other 10 per cent it never fades\
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals\
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the\
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up\
And just remember just to hold out more\
A couple years ago\
I couldn't just control that thought\
You'd find me buskin' on the street\
When it was cold outdoors\
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour\
Writing love songs for the sake of it\
Never to make a hit\
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick\
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and\
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses\
Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is\
Dreams you own, just set your goals\
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path\
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know\
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha\
\
\
"Shirtsleeves"\
\
I can taste salt water\
And if I blink again\
You'll be sinking in\
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made\
I'll hold ya and you'll think of him\
And pretty soon you'll be floating away\
\
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of\
Anchored down in the throat, love\
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now\
With just one armband to carry me home\
\
When salted tears won't dry\
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves\
Under your eyes\
These hearts will be flooded tonight\
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves\
Under your eyes\
Your eyes [5x]\
\
I still taste salt water\
On my lips from your kiss, bitterness\
And I'll drown within the oceans you made\
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make up\
I'll never trust you again\
You can just be a friend\
\
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of\
Anchored down in the throat, love\
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now\
With just one armband to carry me home\
\
When salted tears won't dry\
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves\
Under your eyes\
These hearts will be flooded tonight\
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves\
Under your eyes\
\
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth\
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild\
Tonight, the fact is I...\
I'm on my way home\
I'm on my way home\
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm, I'm drowning in the oceans you made\
\
When salted tears won't dry\
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves\
Under your eyes\
These hearts will be flooded tonight\
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves\
Under your eyes\
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes\
\
\
"Even My Dad Does Sometimes"\
\
It's alright to cry\
Even my dad does sometimes\
So don't wipe your eyes\
Tears remind you you're alive\
\
It's alright to die\
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried\
But just for tonight\
Hold on\
\
So live life like you're giving up\
'Cause you act like you are\
Go ahead and just live it up\
Go on and tear me apart\
\
It's alright to shake\
Even my hand does sometimes\
So inside we rage\
Against the dying of the light\
\
It's alright to say\
That death's the only thing you haven't tried\
But just for today\
Hold on\
\
So live life like you're giving up\
'Cause you act like you are\
Go ahead and just live it up\
Go on and tear me apart\
Hold on\
\
Live life like you're giving up\
'Cause you act like you are\
Go ahead and just live it up\
Go on and tear me apart\
And hold on\

\
"I See Fire"\
\
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below\
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls\
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke\
Keep watching over Durin's sons\
\
If this is to end in fire\
Then we should all burn together\
Watch the flames climb high into the night\
\
Calling out father oh\
Stand by and we will\
Watch the flames burn auburn on\
The mountain side\
\
And if we should die tonight\
Then we should all die together\
Raise a glass of wine for the last time\
\
Calling out father oh\
Prepare as we will\
Watch the flames burn auburn on\
The mountain side\
Desolation comes upon the sky\
\
Now I see fire\
Inside the mountain\
I see fire\
Burning the trees\
And I see fire\
Hollowing souls\
I see fire\
Blood in the breeze\
And I hope that you remember me\
\
Oh, should my people fall\
Then surely I'll do the same\
Confined in mountain halls\
We got too close to the flame\
\
Calling out father oh\
Hold fast and we will\
Watch the flames burn auburn on\
The mountain side\
Desolation comes upon the sky\
\
Now I see fire\
Inside the mountain\
I see fire\
Burning the trees\
I see fire\
Hollowing souls\
I see fire\
Blood in the breeze\
And I hope that you remember me\
\
And if the night is burning\
I will cover my eyes\
For if the dark returns\
Then my brothers will die\
And as the sky is falling down\
It crashed into this lonely town\
And with that shadow upon the ground\
I hear my people screaming out\
\
Now I see fire\
Inside the mountains\
I see fire\
Burning the trees\
I see fire\
Hollowing souls\
I see fire\
Blood in the breeze\
\
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out) (fire)\
And I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin, yeah) (fire)\
And I see fire (uh-uh-uh-uh) (fire)\
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side\
\
\
"All Of The Stars"\
\
It's just another night\
And I'm staring at the moon\
I saw a shooting star\
And thought of you\
I sang a lullaby\
By the waterside and knew\
If you were here,\
I'd sing to you\
You're on the other side\
As the skyline splits in two\
I'm miles away from seeing you\
But I can see the stars\
From America\
I wonder, do you see them, too?\
\
So open your eyes and see\
The way our horizons meet\
And all of the lights will lead\
Into the night with me\
And I know these scars will bleed\
But both of our hearts believe\
All of these stars will guide us home\
\
I can hear your heart\
On the radio beat\
They're playing 'Chasing Cars'\
And I thought of us\
Back to the time,\
You were lying next to me\
I looked across and fell in love\
So I took your hand\
Back through lamp-lit streets and knew\
Everything led back to you\
So can you see the stars?\
Over Amsterdam\
You're the song my heart is\
Beating to\
\
So open your eyes and see\
The way our horizons meet\
And all of the lights will lead\
Into the night with me\
And I know these scars will bleed\
But both of our hearts believe\
All of these stars will guide us home\
\
And, oh, I know\
And oh, I know, oh\
I can see the stars\
From America\
\
"English Rose"\
\
Across the sea\
By the Tennessee skyline\
They told me I'd find my\
Hopes and my dreams\
\
But I long to be\
In the bed of my true love\
Back where I came from\
She's waiting for me\
\
So I'll make my way\
Through long winding country roads\
But my heart still beats\
For my home and my English rose\
\
I told my dad\
On the phone it's amazing\
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen\
But I long to be\
In the arms of my true love\
Like he loves my mother\
He understands me\
\
I'll spend my days\
Just travelling and playing shows\
But my heart still beats\
For my home and my English rose\
\
I met a man\
In a bar down in Memphis\
He told me he went there to follow his dreams\
\
He told me, "Son,\
You know, I lost my true love\
For the same exact reason\
That you crossed the sea."\
\
And I found truth\
In people I barely know\
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose\
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose\
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose\
\
\
"Touch And Go"\
\
Waking up, midnight November\
And you're still in my bed\
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya\
There's things we've never said\
\
So if I go for a little while longer\
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road\
If you say go, I would stop everything oh\
My heart would play the role now\
And act like it's never been broke\
\
Though my soul\
Oh, oh, oh lately I really need to know\
How long, how long, can we be touch and go\
Oh my soul, oh oh oh\
How long, how long, can we be touch and go\
\
It's not enough, to say I want ya\
Cause I'll say anything\
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt\
I ha... have just been questioning yeah\
\
If I go for a little while longer\
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road\
If you say go, I would stop everything oh\
My heart would play the role\
And act like it's never been broke\
\
Though my soul\
Oh, oh, oh lately I really need to know\
How long, how long, can we be touch and go\
Oh my soul, oh oh oh\
How long, how long, can we be\
\
All of my bones, they scream I'm right\
If you're taking me home to stay the night\
Darling my soul would heal\
\
If you say go, I would stop everything oh\
My heart would play the role\
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul\
Lately I really need to know\
How long, how long, can we be touch and go\
Oh my soul, oh, oh, oh\
How long, how long, can we be touch and go\
How long, how long, can we be touch and go\
How long, how long, can we be touch and go\
\
\
"New York"\
\
Ooh, ooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh now now\
\
Five drinks in on Friday night\
We only came to dry your eyes\
And get you out of your room\
\
Now this bar has closed its doors\
I found my hand is holding yours\
Do you wanna go home so soon?\
\
Or maybe we should take a ride\
Through the night\
And sing along to every song\
That's on the radio\
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn no, no, no\
The sun could rise\
Burning all the street lamps out at 3 AM\
So DJ, play it again\
\
Until the night turns into morning\
You'll be in my arms\
And we'll just keep driving\
Along the boulevard\
And if I kissed you, darling\
Please don't be alarmed\
It's just the start of everything if you want a new love in New York\
\
Yesterday you gave me a call\
Stressing out about it all\
Said the world is moving too fast\
\
And you don't know where to begin\
'Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in\
Only to wind up on the other side\
\
By yourself\
And every day\
Screaming out\
To all the people that you used to know\
From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline\
It's just the way that life goes\
And you hear it in every song you know\
So DJ, play it again\
\
Until the night turns into morning\
You'll be in my arms\
And we'll just keep driving\
Along the boulevard\
And if I kissed you, darling\
Please don't be alarmed\
It's just the start of everything if you want a new life in New York\
\
And every song that plays\
Is just like the day you had\
And it's okay to cry\
But I'm saying maybe that's a waste of water\
You know I'm here for you\
In the back of the taxi cab tonight in New York\
\
It's just reached the morning\
And you're still in my arms\
Now we've stopped driving\
Down the boulevard\
And I just kissed you, darling\
I hope you weren't alarmed\
It's just the start of everything that you want: a new love in New York\
\
A new life in New York\
